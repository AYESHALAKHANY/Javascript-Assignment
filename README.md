JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.
JavaScript is often used to add interactive elements to websites, such as animations, forms, and responsive design, and is an essential tool for web development. It is also used in mobile and desktop app development, game development,
and server-side programming with technologies like Node.js.
